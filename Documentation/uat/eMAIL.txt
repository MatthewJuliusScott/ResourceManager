Jon,

 

Please find attached UAT script.

 

Connect to https://ms.havealookdemo.com.au .

 

User: user@gmail.com

 

Password: password

 

Currently we don’t have a method for creating users so every user has the same password.

Also anything not on the scripts is not necessarily functional so may not work as intended

 

If you need help let me know.
