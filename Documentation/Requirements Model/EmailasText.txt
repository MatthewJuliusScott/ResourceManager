Subject: ITC303 Resource Manager - Requirement Questionnaire 

Jon,

Could you please answer the questions below with your best estimates so we can build requirements documentation for the project.

What do you consider the Critical and Core components of the system?
-                      Ease of ability to enter and consume data/information around individual availability
-                      Ability to quickly see / identify ‘white space’ around resources
-                      Understand individuals skills and experience
Are there maximum limits to processing or response times?
-                      No, obviously a performant system that doesn’t take too long to load pages / provide right information
Are there maximum limits to reporting or audit times?
-                      Similar to above, as long as reporting is provided in a timely manager that will be fine.
How many transactions should the system store?
-          Assume system is scaled for between 60-100 users, each will have around 3-4 allocations per year
How much data does the system need to be able to communicate in a short space of time? 
-          As much as needed by the user, will vary based on usage patterns and demand
When does the system need to be available? 
-          Ideally 24x7 given we are a global organisation and will have multiple inputs.
Where does the system need to be accessible from?
-          Anywhere, assume web
What is an acceptable mean time between failures?
-          Depends on what we define ‘failure’ as, ideally zero failures for inputs and reporting, the solution needs to be stable and performant 
What is an acceptable mean time to recovery?
-          Whilst it’s not a business critical system it is important, the business could survive offline for numerous days
How important is it that I/O failures are handled? 
-          Depends on what we define failure as within this eco-system
How long should the recovery process take? 
-          Depends on how the application is hosted i.e. public cloud, then it might be highly available with VM fail over. 
How often should the data be backed up? 
-          Daily as a minimum, a lot can change within a day so data impact would be significant but manageable. 
What other systems does the solution need to be compatible with? 
-          Other than common browsers none.
Will the entire project team be able to access these systems?
Does the system need to be able to run on multiple platforms?
            If so, which platforms? Assume common web browsers, and mobile browser
Are there any conformance to certain standards requirements?
-          Other than data privacy, protection and retention standards of Micro Focus, none others are known.
Are there any look and feel standards that need to be adhered to?
-          None
What documentation is required?
-          User guides are important, depending on support model High Level Design, As Built Guides.
