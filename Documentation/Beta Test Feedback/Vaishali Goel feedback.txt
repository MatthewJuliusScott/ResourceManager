Aaron, I actually got a chance to go in the app and test it. Couple of high-level feedback. I didn’t try creating new resource.

 

-          Very clear and precise links

-          Self-explanatory and seamless process from one tab to another.

 

But

-          Couldn’t allocate resources to the Projects despite having required skills

-          Also resource availability tab could be good to have as resource might not be available despite having the required skill

 

Happy to discuss.

 

Regards,
