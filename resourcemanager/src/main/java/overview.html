	<h1>ResourceManager : Manage resources and prevent scheduling short-fall and conflicts</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div>
		A web-based application which allows consultants to enter their skill-set and have project managers and team leaders look up a skill set to identify availability of the skills to map onto a project time line.
	</div>
	<h2>How to use</h2>
	<div>
		Import the project in to eclipse and run Application.java as a Java Application. It will then launch an embedded Apache Tomcat server which you can access in your web browser at https://localhost
	</div>
	<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
	<div>
		If you have any errors you might need to right click on the project > Maven > update project to download required library files. Using the default application.properties file it does require that MySQL server is installed and running using the default settings, and that a database has been created called testDB. Otherwise another properties file has been created for integration tests and is not for use in a production environment. Replacing application.properties under src/main/resources with the contents of application-integrationtest.properties from src/test/resources will instead launch the application using an embedded H2 database and not require an installation of MySQL server.
	</div>
	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
	<div>
		The project makes use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller pattern</a> to model the internal representation of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. It also makes use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_layer_pattern">Service layer pattern</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object">Data Access Object pattern</a> to abstract the persistence layer.
