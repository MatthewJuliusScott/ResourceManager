# TEAM CHARTER

## Team Name
Resource Manager

## Purpose
To develop a tool which can manage staff skillsets as they align to project requirements to identify potential resourcing issues.

## Commitment
The following team members hence forth agree and commit to the following time per week:
**Brodie:** 
**Aaron:** Up to 10 hours per week as required (on average), this time will mostly be on Fridays during the day as I have organised to have this day off work for university study. 
**Matthew:**  Available weekends mostly, some availability during the week nights when necessary but not as a rule.
**Jack:** Primarily will be able to contribute Friday to Sunday
**Values:** Honesty, integrity, respect, equality (in no specific order)

## Motto
No Surprises

## Rules
### Team
To ensure code is ready to be reviewed, it is to be submitted 1 day prior to the expected review date, this allows the reviewer to review the content at any stage during the day. The reviewer must have the code review completed within 48 hours (2 days) the code review to allow enough time to merge all branches in a suitable time.

Be honest, but not mean, if you disagree with another member of the team, state the issue with what is being said or done, and allow organisational structure ensure the outcome.

Notify of lateness early, if you know you will be unable to deliver in time, notify the team to enable someone else to cover for you, this will likely need to go both ways at some stage during the year.

## Goals
To deliver a system which meets the requirements lay out before us.

## Roles and responsibilities
All team members have equal standing within the team and will be expected to contribute using their primary strengths. 
**Brodie:** IT Support officer experience, Java application development experience	
**Aaron:** Java, C# and SQL programming experience, and some history with Linux administration, have worked with various Web hosting tools and have done some enterprise level systems documentation. I have no experience with Javascript but I am excited to learn and will be doing some for ITC363 this semester.
**Matthew:** Java, C#, Javascript, MySQL and some knowledge in most web frameworks. Strong web app development experience.
**Jack:** C#, VB, Javascript, MSSQL, strong development of data management systems, willing to learn new languages

## Mutual expectations
It is expected that each team member agrees to the Team Charter and upholds their part. If a team member is struggling to meet their goals for the week it is expected they will communicate this with the other members of the team.

## Operating procedures
### Communication
The primary method of communication will be the team discord server https://discord.gg/nVUmFr  if this method fails, use the Send email group tool for formal notification.
### Meetings
The team will have a meeting every week to discuss required work, this meeting can be cancelled if all team members agree and have nothing to update other members on.
### Organisational structure
We have elected not to have a team leader and our standard method of conflict resolution and decision making will be via majority team vote. If as a team a decision can still not be reached a coin toss will be used to decide the direction.
### Misconduct management
In the unlikely event a team member is not performing to the satisfaction of this document and the other team members, they will be given a written warning to which they will be expected to respond with an acknowledgment and proposed solution a record of this communication must be made in the teams meeting minutes for that week to ensure accountability. Should it happen again, they will again be given a written warning and this time our lecturer will be informed, finally upon a third infraction they will be asked to leave the team.
